##Hypotheses in Threat Hunting

A threat-hunting hypothesis, much like a scientific hypothesis, is a statement proposing an idea or explanation to be tested against data. While tools can aid in threat hunting, the formulation of a hypothesis relies on the expertise of a human analyst. Effective hypotheses should be:

Human-Driven Threat Hunting
One of the defining characteristics of threat hunting is that it is human-driven and cannot be fully automated. The generation of a hypothesis is a crucial part of this process, reflecting the threats that align with the threat hunter's suspicions. Hypotheses are primarily generated through:
Observation of Deviations: Detecting anomalies or deviations from baseline activities and patterns within the network.
Experience: Leveraging the threat hunter's previous experience and knowledge.
External Information: Incorporating insights from threat intelligence and other external sources.
This human-driven approach ensures that threat hunting remains flexible and adaptive, enabling threat hunters to effectively identify and respond to potential threats.
Actionable: Providing clear guidance on what actions to take.
Testable: Allowing for validation or refutation through data analysis.
Dynamic: Continuously refined and adjusted based on new information and insights.
By creating actionable, testable, and continually refined hypotheses, threat hunters can systematically investigate and mitigate potential threats within an organization's network.
